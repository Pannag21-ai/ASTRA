# Astra — Web Prototype

Astra web prototype (React + Vite + TypeScript) — minimal demo of:
- Short profiler → selects a learning path (visual / auditory / kinesthetic)
- Simple lesson player for basic addition using lesson JSON
- Low-stimulation and dyslexia-friendly UI toggles

Quick start:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. Open http://localhost:5173

Structure:
- src/ contains React app
- src/data/lesson_addition.json contains the lesson used in the demo
- public/assets/ for images/audio/fonts

Notes:
- Add OpenDyslexic font to public/assets/fonts and update CSS to enable dyslexia mode.
- No backend is configured — all local for demo.
```
